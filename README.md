# foxhole-quartermaster
An application for compiling and tracking stockpile data for the game Foxhole.

*NOTE: Heavily WIP*

## Goal(s)

1) A simple stockpile management tool that involves screenshots, and translating those screenshots into spreadsheets.
2) Ease of usage for all players.
3) Powerful analytical tools and insights.

## TODO

-All the item mappings are not finished; I play warden, and have yet to finish updating the colonials weaponry, and most of the vehicles.
